            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>As the name implies, this song reads like any other "bar song." There is not much substance to Shaboozey's work and it's overly repetitive in nature. While it does come with some solid instrumentals, there is really not much to say about this song. It is also safe to assume most people know that when one goes to a bar the intention is to get "tipsy."</p>
