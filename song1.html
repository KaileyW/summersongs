            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>Despite his genre change, it appears Post Palone still has no trouble making the top of the charts. He has risen to the top this past summer joined by fellow coutnry star Morgan Wallen. While the song is fluid and can easily be sung along to, it lacks catchy lyrics that jump out at the listener. It's a song that is easily forgotten.</p>
