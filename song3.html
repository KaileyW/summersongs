            <h2>My Review</h2>
            <p>From The Sixth Sense reference at the beginning to the multitude of iconic lines, this song is one to remember. Kendrick made big waves this summer following this as well as a second Drake dis track which made a great deal of accusations toward him. The song itself is extremely catchy and certainly one of the best dis tracks in this industry recently.</p>
